# Parasyte report:

Short, sweet, well-laid storyline. All in one, balanced & so
amazingly animated, that I watched this series like 3 times, 
am reading the manga currently and almost caught up. This one
is a short anime series unlike the other ones mentioned in this
folder. Soo, be sure to check it out!

(BTW its about an alien species and how as humans we get a
glimpse that maybe we may be the monsters and not the aliens
as how it always is portrayed!)
