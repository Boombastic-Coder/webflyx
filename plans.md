# Plans:

I Think we should create a new folder called 'animeFiles' in the
main 'git_crackin' directory, to include various favourite anime
reports. Let's add more details in this file (if confirmed from
team) to talk about this in depth!


# Update:
Ok, so I talked to my team, and they said they were happy with 
the idea! So here are the titles we're going to add:

- hajime no ippo
- chainsawman
- one piece
- dragonball
- alice in borderland
- parasyte

... among the few, more will be added soon! (I'll be sure to
update here, if any changes in plans).
