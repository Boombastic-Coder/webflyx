# Chainsawman report:

Chainsawman written by Tatsuki fujimoto, and in my opinion (again),
it is one of the best mordern anime and manga ever written.
All anime series are controversial, in the sense, everyone has
their own opinion about what is and is not good. So, take this
from a guy who loves anime like crazy.
